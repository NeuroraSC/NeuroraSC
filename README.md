## 🐔 Chicken Disease Detector  

Our main project, the **Chicken Disease Detector**, aims to automate disease detection in chickens using AI. By analyzing chicken droppings, our system can detect early signs of disease, helping farmers manage and prevent outbreaks more effectively. This project integrates **computer vision** techniques to provide accurate and timely disease detection, ultimately improving poultry welfare and optimizing farm management.  

### 🛠️ Technologies Used  
To develop the *Chicken Disease Detector*, we use the following technologies:  
- Python 🐍: The primary programming language for data processing and AI model development.  
- PyTorch 🔥: A deep learning framework for building and training AI models with high flexibility.  
- JavaScript 🌐: Used for deploying the application on both the frontend and backend.
